-### `-sdy-reshard-to-collectives`
-
-_Converts ReshardOp into various Shardy collective ops._
-
-Here we match reshard ops and rewrite them into various Shardy collective
- ops. After this pass, no reshard ops remain in the module. This pass assumes
- that xplicit reshards have already been inserted
- (`sdy-insert-explicit-reshards`).
-
- A clarifying example:
-
- Input:
- ```mlir
- mesh = <"x"=2, "y"=2, "z"=2>
- %0 : tensor<16x2xf32> {sdy.sharding<@mesh, \[{"x", "y", "z"}, {}\]>
- %1 = sdy.reshard %arg0 <@mesh, \[{"x"}, {}\]> : tensor<16x2xf32>
- ```
-
- Output:
- ```mlir
- mesh = <"x"=2, "y"=2, "z"=2>
- %0 : tensor<16x2xf32> {sdy.sharding<@mesh, \[{"x", "y", "z"}, {}\]>
- %1 = sdy.all_gather  \[{"y", "z"}, {}\] %arg0 out_sharding=<@mesh, \[{"x"}, {}\]> : tensor<16x2xf32>
- ```
-
- In the example above, the tensor `%0 : tensor<16x2xf32>` is sharded as
- `\[{"x", "y", "z"}, {}\]`. Then, there's a `reshard` op resharding it as
- `\[{"x"}, {}\]`. On the first axes, since the suffix `{"y", "z"}` is removed
- after the reshard, we infer that we have all-gathered `{"y", "z"}`. The
- second dimension is not changed.
